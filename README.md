# TCZiraatbankAutomation-web-test
It is a web automation example. Ziraat Bank webpage is used. The primary purpose is that if customers want to know some values such as installment amount, interest rate, annual cost rate, they can calculate specific credit types and view related deals.

I put them in the examples section to make the assertion, but they can be changed deals according to the bank's schedule.

It is coded considering OOP logic; therefore, Ä± create objects of classes to use their attributes.
