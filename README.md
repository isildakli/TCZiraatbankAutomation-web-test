# Web Site Test Automation

*It is a web automation example. Ziraat Bank webpage is used. The primary purpose is that if customers want to know some values such as installment amount, interest rate, annual cost rate, they can calculate specific credit types and view related deals.
I put data in the examples section to make the assertion, but data can change according to the bank's schedule.
It is coded considering OOP logic; therefore, Ä± create objects of classes to use their attributes.*


## Features

- Goes to the bank webpage 
- Opens the credits web page and goes calculator page
- Selects credit type in each time differently
- Puts the related data 
- Checks bank offer


> It summarizes the project.
